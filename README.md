# Task-Allocation-with-Audio-files
Build a system that processes audio recordings of meetings and automatically assigns tasks to team members based on the meeting content. In team meetings, multiple tasks are discussed and need to be assigned to appropriate team members. The goal is to automate task identification, prioritization, and assignment from meeting discussions.
