# Project: Meeting Task Assignment

## Overview

Build a system that processes audio recordings of meetings and automatically assigns tasks to team members based on the meeting content.

## Problem Statement

In team meetings, multiple tasks are discussed and need to be assigned to appropriate team members. Currently, this process is manual and time-consuming. The goal is to automate task identification, prioritization, and assignment from meeting discussions.

## Example Scenario

### Meeting Context

A product development team has a weekly standup meeting discussing their mobile app project.

### Input:

**Audio Recording Contains:**

> "Hi everyone, let's discuss this week's priorities.
> Sakshi, we need someone to fix the critical login bug that users reported yesterday. This needs to be done by tomorrow evening since it's blocking users.
> Also, the database performance is really slow, Mohit you're good with backend optimization right? We should tackle this by end of this week, it's affecting the user experience.
> And we need to update the API documentation before Friday's release - this is high priority.
> Oh, and someone should design the new onboarding screens for the next sprint. Arjun, didn't you work on UI designs last month? This can wait until next Monday.
> One more thing - we need to write unit tests for the payment module. This depends on the login bug fix being completed first, so let's plan this for Wednesday."

### Team Members:

| Name   | Role               | Skills                                   |
| :----- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Sakshi | Frontend Developer | React, JavaScript, UI bugs               |
| Mohit  | Backend Engineer   | Database, APIs, Performance optimization |
| Arjun  | UI/UX Designer     | Figma, User flows, Mobile design         |
| Lata   | QA Engineer        | Testing, Automation, Quality assurance   |

### Expected Output:

**Identified Tasks with Details:**

| #   | Task Description                    | Assigned To | Deadline         | Priority        | Dependencies (Optional) | Reason (Optional)               |
| :-- | :---------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| 1   | Fix critical login bug              | Sakshi      | Tomorrow evening | Critical / High | —                       | Frontend task, blocking users   |
| 2   | Optimize database performance       | Mohit       | End of this week | High            | —                       | Backend expertise               |
| 3   | Update API documentation            | Mohit       | Friday           | High            | —                       | Backend-related, before release |
| 4   | Design new onboarding screens       | Arjun       | Next Monday      | Medium          | —                       | UI/UX task, relevant experience |
| 5   | Write unit tests for payment module | Lata        | Wednesday        | Medium          | Depends on Task #1      | QA expertise, testing task      |

## Input Requirements

Your system should accept:

1.  **Audio File**
    - Format: `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.m4a`
    - Contains a recorded team meeting with task discussions
2.  **Team Member Information**
    - List of available team members
    - Role and skill details for assignment logic

## Output Requirements

Your system must produce:

### Minimum Required:

1.  **List of Identified Tasks**
    - Each task extracted from the meeting
    - Clear description of what needs to be done
2.  **Task Assignments**
    - Which team member is assigned to which task
    - (Optional) Include reasoning if mentioned or inferred

### Additional Extractable Information:

- **Deadlines / Timeline** — e.g., “tomorrow”, “next week”, “by Friday”
- **Priority Levels** — Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Dependencies (Optional)** — Task relationships like “depends on Task #1”
- **Contextual Notes (Optional)** — Mentions of blockers or special conditions

## Technical Constraints

### ALLOWED:

- Use any external API or service for Speech-to-Text conversion (e.g., Whisper, Google STT)
- Use any library for parsing, NLP, or logic building
- You can train your own model or Your logic for task identification and assignment

### NOT ALLOWED:

- No external APIs or pre-trained models for task classification or assignment logic
- No external automation tools that perform the core decision-making

### Note:

The Speech-to-Text step can use external services, but identifying and assigning tasks must be your own logic or model.

## Deliverables

1.  **Source Code**
    - Clearly organized file structure
    - Include a `requirements.txt` file
2.  **Test Data (Optional)**
    - Sample audio file(s)
    - Sample team member data
    - Expected output JSON or table
3.  **Demo Video**
    - Short walkthrough explaining your logic and result
